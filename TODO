- convert tree to have some sort of identifier on the links so that 
    items in the node container can effect the tree
- create a dialog box handler that does generic ajax calls
    - all calls to server return a JSON object
    - object indicates success/failure, what part of the tree to refresh,
      error messages etc.
- switch to more dynamic tree?
